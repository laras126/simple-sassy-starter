// Shameful Styles

// :(

// Put all of the styles you are ashamed of in here. Everything where you're like, "ah, I know I shouldn't do it this way, but whatever for now". For example 

// .crap ul > li#purple > a:hover {
//	  color: brown !important;
// }

// Try not to do that. 
// But, I know, we all do it...that's why there's _shame.scss!

// That being said, feel free to change the name of this file to something less self-depracating. Sometimes I call it _holding.scss if I'm feeling particularly sensitive that day.
