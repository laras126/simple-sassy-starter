// Here's a simple button mixin. Instead of keeping it in utility/_mixin.scss, I'm putting it here so we can easily reference it without going into a new file.

@mixin button($background, $text-color: $text-light) {
	background-color: $background;
	color: $text-color;
	padding: $base $h4;
	text-decoration: none;
}

// A note about naming: instead of .default-btn, I like to have .btn first so that it's more easily scannable. Change it up as you like!

// Default button
.btn-default {
	@include button($accent-dark); // You'll notice there isn't a $text-color parameter here. That's because we defined a default as $text-light.
}

// Info button, maybe for "Read More" or something.
.btn-info {
	@include button($notice-info, $text-dark);
}
