// These are little packages of code you can include within other selectors instead of rewriting the styles all the time. For example:

%btn {
	padding: $base $h4;
	text-decoration: none;	
}

// What's the %?
// It's called a "placeholder selector" and does not compile to your CSS. You can also use a regular . to use that class in your HTML. 
// Confused? Me too.
